Analysing client needs for their cinema festival

* * *

### Client Request

Jennifer Viala is the founder of Brooklyn Vibes Events Co. and is also the organiser of this year’s Brooklyn Outdoor Film 
Festival. She hopes to select and show films from August 5th to 8th at Brooklyn Bridge Park, a major entertainment venue 
in New York that can hold up to 5,000 people. She wants to create an event that shows that films can appeal to audiences 
of all ages, and she wants her advertisements and publications to reflect that same idea! Jennifer has a budget of $3,500 
to get the event website up and running. She needs to communicate online about her festival to announce the 
upcoming showings and take reservations!

### Solution

We wanted the website to be accessible from all devices, so I focused on buildiang it using twitter's 
[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) technology. My target was to create a responsive website that looks simple and 
clear — using this technology allowed for speedy delivery. I didn't have to code from scratch; therefore, I was able to 
stay within the $3500 build budget. This project demonstrates front end entry-level design skills along with primary usage 
of JavaScript (jQuery) to animate scrolling, showing additional buttons when specific criteria are met as well as custom 
code validation that is done on client-side.
