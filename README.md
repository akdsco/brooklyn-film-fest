Website promoting film festival event in Brooklyn, New York.
<a href="http://brooklyn-festival.ostrowski.co" target="_blank">Live Website</a>

### Project Description:

Jennifer Viala is the founder of Brooklyn Vibes Events Co. and is also the organizer of this year’s Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival. She hopes to select and show films from August 5th to 8th at Brooklyn Bridge Park, a major entertainment venue in New York that can hold up to 5,000 people.

She wants to create an event that shows that films can appeal to audiences of all ages, and she wants her advertisements and publications to reflect that same idea!

Jennifer has a budget of $3,500 to get the event website up and running. She needs to communicate online about her festival in order to announce the upcoming showings and take reservations!

Here's what Jennifer says:


>My company, "Brooklyn Outdoor Film Festival" just got the approval to show movies at Brooklyn Bridge Park this year from August 5th through 8th, from 6pm to midnight. We can't wait to help the public discover awesome films! 
>
> I need to publicize the festival, and to do this, I need a website. On this site, I need to display information about the festival, the films we're showing, and regularly published news or announcements about the festival.
>
>There should also be links to the city of Brooklyn’s news website, the Brooklyn Bridge Park’s website, and our Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts somewhere on the page (navigation bar, footer links, etc). Since I haven't created these accounts yet, you can just have each social media icon as a link to its homepage (ex. https://twitter.com). 
>
>Shows will be free and open to everyone, but I want people to be able to pre-register so that I'm able to estimate how many people might come and so that we can close registration if it reaches the venue’s capacity of 5,000 people.
>
>I'd like to have a professional web address, either a .com or .org -- you decide, but just make sure it's relevant to the film festival.

### Solution

Since we wanted the website to be accessible from all devices, we focused on building website using twitter’s bootstrap technology to deliver fully responsive website that looks outstanding and is done along with current search engine optimisation directives as we would like people to be able to find out about us online and attend our event, registering by using our online form. Using this technology also cuts down development time, because we won’t have to code from scratch and therefore we are able to stay within $3500 build budget.
