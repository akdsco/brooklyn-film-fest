## Technical Specifications
Since we wanted the website to be accessible from all devices, we focused on building website using twitter’s bootstrap technology to deliver fully responsive website that looks outstanding and is done along with current search engine optimisation directives as we would like people to be able to find out about us online and attend our event, registering by using our online form. Using this technology also cuts down development time, because we won’t have to code from scratch and therefore we are able to stay within $3500 build budget.
